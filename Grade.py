The newly appointed Vice-Chancellor of Anna University wanted to create an automated grading system for the students to check their grade. When a student enters a mark, the grading system displays the corresponding grade.
Write a program to solve the given problem.
Marks scored    Grade 
100               S
90 - 99           A
80 - 89           B
70 - 79           C
60 - 69           D
50 - 59           E
<50               F

Input format:
The input consists of one integer which corresponds to the marks scored by the student

Output format:
If a student marks greater than 100, print "Invalid Input". Otherwise, print the grade.

'''


# Program to determine grade based on marks

# Get input from the user
marks = int(input("Enter the marks scored by the student:\n"))

# Determine the grade based on the marks
if marks > 100:
    print("Invalid Input")
elif marks == 100:
    print("S")
elif 90 <= marks < 100:
    print("A")
elif 80 <= marks < 90:
    print("B")
elif 70 <= marks < 80:
    print("C")
elif 60 <= marks < 70:
    print("D")
elif 50 <= marks < 60:
    print("E")
elif marks < 50:
    print("F")

Enter the marks scored by the student:
